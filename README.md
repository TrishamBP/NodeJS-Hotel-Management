</p>
<p> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Hotel Management app allows users to add, remove, list and read their reservation for a restaurant along with relevant details like name, time of reservation and seats reserved from a JSON file using node through the command line interface. The app also lets users know if there is already a seat reserved at a given time and if they have made double reservation.
